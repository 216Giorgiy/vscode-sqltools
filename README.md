## Donate

SQLTools was developed with â™¥ to save us time during our programming journey. But It also takes me time and efforts to develop SQLTools.

SQLTools will save you (for sure) a lot of time and help you to increase your productivity so, I hope you can donate and help SQLTools to become more awesome than ever.
